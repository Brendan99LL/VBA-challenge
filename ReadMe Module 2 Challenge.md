# Module 2 Challenge

For this challenge, we will be using VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

## Files Provided

* alphabetical_testing:  This is the test file that is used to create the VBA script and make sure all the requirements are met.

    File Name:  alphabetical_testing.xlsx

* Multiple_year_stock_data:  This is the file that would run the script and whos results would be sumbitted.

    File Name:  Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx

## Files Submitted

* Module 2 Challenge Final Stock VBA Code:  VBA script used to run the script loop to analyze the generated stock market data within the Multiple_year_stock_data file
* Module 2 Challenge Sheet 1 Results:  PDF containing the results of the VBA script for Sheet 1 of the Multiple_year_stock_data file
* Module 2 Challenge Sheet 2 Results:  PDF containing the results of the VBA script for Sheet 2 of the Multiple_year_stock_data file
* Module 2 Challenge Sheet 3 Results:  PDF containing the results of the VBA script for Sheet 3 of the Multiple_year_stock_data file
* Module 2 Challenge Sheet 4 Results:  PDF containing the results of teh VBA script for Sheet 4 of the Multiple_year_stock_data file
* ReadMe Module 2 Challenge:  ReadMe file explaining the instructions of the challenge and how to run the final VBA script

## Steps

    ## Part 1
        * Create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:
            - The ticker symbol
            - Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter
            - The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter
            - The total stock volume of the stock
        # NOTE: Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
    
    ## Part 2
        * Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the"
            - "Greatest % increase"
            - "Greatest % decrease"
            - "Greatest total volume"
    
    ## Part 3
        * Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to turn on every worksheet (that is, every quarter) at once.

## Other Considerations
    * Use the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing your code. This dataset is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in just a few seconds.
    * Make sure that the script acts the same on every sheet. The joy of VBA is that it takes the tediousness out of repetitive tasks with the click of a button.

## How to run VBA Script

To run the functionality of the VBA script submitted, run the code as Macros within the "Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx" file.  The results of the VBA scripts would show similar results as illustrated in the images provided in the Module 2 Challenge.
